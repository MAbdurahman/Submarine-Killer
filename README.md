# Submarine-Killer
Submarine Killer implements a simple 2D arcade game in which the user tries to blow up a submarine by dropping depth charges from a 
battleship.  The user moves the battleship with the left and right arrow keys, and drops the depth charges with the down arrow key.
The submarine moves erratically left and right along the bottow of the panel.  For each game, the user has 25 opportunities to blow
up the submarine.
